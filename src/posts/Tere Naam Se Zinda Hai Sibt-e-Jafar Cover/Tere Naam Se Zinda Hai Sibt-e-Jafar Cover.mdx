<p>Tere Naam Se Zinda Hai Sibt-e-Jafar Cover is my first ever recitation and I think it is a perfect start to my recitations because I love this manqabat. It is in praise of Imam Hussain A.S, grandson of Prophet Muhammad PBUH.</p>
<p>Shaheed Sibt-e-Jafar has rendered this very beautifully and nobody can match his rendition and the quality of his voice.</p>
<p>Hope everyone likes this. Make sure to share with your friends and family! ðŸ™‚</p>
