<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Khuda Ka Zikr Karay****, Zikr-e-Mustafa Na Karay**</span></p>
<p>Hello Everyone,</p>
<p>I am attempting to cover this beautiful naat “Khuda Ka Zikr Karay, Zikr-e-Mustafa Na Karay” by Qari Waheed Zafar Qasmi Sahab. One of my favorite naat and has beautiful lyrics by Adeeb Raipuri. The whole gist of this naat is that how can you just remember and do the Zikr of the Almighty God, Allah Subhanauh Wa Ta’Aala without remembering His beloved Prophet, Hazrat Muhammad Mustafa (SAWW).</p>
<p>This naat also tries to express the feeling one has when he is in the Holy city of Madina Munawwara and Masjid-e-Nabawi.</p>
<p>Check out the full lyrics / write-up at <a href="http://www.abulhasanlakhani.com/khuda-ka-zikr-qari-waheed-zafar-qasmi/">http://www.abulhasanlakhani.com/khuda-ka-zikr-qari-waheed-zafar-qasmi/</a></p>
