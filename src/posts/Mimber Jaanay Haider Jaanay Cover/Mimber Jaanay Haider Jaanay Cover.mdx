<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">**Mimber Jaanay Haider Jaanay Cover**</span></p>
<p>This is my first recitation for any Mir Hasan Mir’s manqabat. I really love it and therefore, it is one of my all time favorite manqabat. Shaheed Ustad Sibt-e-Jafar Zaidi has written it very beautifully as he has always done with all his kalaams.</p>
<p>It was a bit difficult to recite and therefore to match the quality that brother Mir Hasan has produced but anyways I have tried my best adjusting according to my capabilities.</p>
