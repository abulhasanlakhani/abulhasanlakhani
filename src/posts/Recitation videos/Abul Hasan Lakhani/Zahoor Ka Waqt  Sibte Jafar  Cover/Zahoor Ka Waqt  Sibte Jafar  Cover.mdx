<p>This is my cover for Zahoor Ka Waqt Aa Gaya Hai by Sibt-e-Jafar and it is my second recitation. I love this manqabat too and is one of my favorite. It tells us what should we do while we wait for our Imam ul Hujjat, Imam Mehdi AJTF, and how to prepare for his reappearance.</p>
<p>As always, Shaheed Sibt-e-Jafar has rendered this very beautifully and nobody would ever be able to match his rendition and the quality of his voice. His son Abuzar Zaidi has also recited this kalaamÂ in of the program in Karachi, Pakistan and you can watch it on this URL:</p>
