<p>Hello and Assalam-o-Alaikum,</p>
<p>This is a cover for very beautiful rubaee recited by Syed Izhaar Hussain on Hazrat Abbas (A.S). Hazrat Abbas (A.S) is revered by Sunni and Shiite Muslims for his loyalty to his half-brother Hazrat Hussein Ibn-e-Abi Taalib (A.S), his respect for the Households of Muhammad, and his role in the Battle of Karbala. Abbas (A.S) is buried in the Shrine of Abbas in Karbala, Karbala Governorate, Iraq, where he was martyred during the Battle of Karbala on the day of Ashura.</p>
